            I have two great loves in life: music and language.  

Music and I have a history dating all the way back 16 years ago when I was just a 
youngster of 10 years old, and, like the myriad other 90’s kids, video games were my favorite pass time. All the times my brother, my friends, and I sat on the carpet in front of the ungodly huge wooden-cased CRT that played a high-pitched dog-whistle screech when turned to play Nintendo games are now some of my warmest and most cherished memories. Video games were my first contact with music, as well as my first true creative impetus. Even today, my music is instantly recognizable as “belonging in a video game”. Some of my favorite video games include: “Legend of Zelda: Windwaker”, “Kirby Dreamland 3”, “Risk of Rain”, and “Tetris Attack”. 

My fascination with language also started in my kinder-days. In 1st grade I created my own 
“language” (now that I think of it, it was more like a code) from scratch in order to encrypt notes to send to my friends during class. It was called “Corex” and was based on a series of X’s and diacritical dots and slashes. My friends and I would then carry the corresponding charts around with us to encode and decode secret “spy” messages. And then once the second generation of Pokémon came out into the world, we also used the “Unknown” alphabet to write messages. My love of languages to this day has not wavered one bit, rather, strengthening ten-fold. I imbibe daily in Mandarin Chinese (especially since my fiancée is Chinese) and my yearly target language (Spanish this year!). So far, I have become proficient in 3 Chinese languages and have studied about 9 languages altogether.  

Life always needs some sort of spark to it. I never want to have my joy of life destroyed by mundane activities. 
Life is about keeping healthy in body, mind, and spirit while doing the things you love and being around the people you love. I do what I want and surround myself with the people I cherish regardless of the situation. Money is great and all, but in the end, it’s just the means to an end, not an end in and of itself.
